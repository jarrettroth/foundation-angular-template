# Simple Template using Foundation 6, Angular, and Jasmine

This is the basic starter project for [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites). 

### What you get
- It includes a Sass compiler and a starter HTML file for you.  
- Simple controller and module template for angular quick start.
- Single test file with 1 failing test (It's meant to fail)

### Prerequisits 

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Gulp-Cli](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp-cli) (installed globally)
```bash
npm install -g gulp-cli
```
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)(installed globally)
```bash
npm install -g gulp
```

### Using the Template

Clone the repository.

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

### Give it a whirl

Start it up

```bash
gulp
```

Run a single test to watch it fail (then fix it, of course)

```bash
gulp single-test
```

Run a continuous testing server

```bash
gulp continuous-test
```
